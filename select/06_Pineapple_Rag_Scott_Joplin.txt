Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
Rode us all the way into New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playing soft while Bobby sang the blues-ah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang ev'ry song that driver knew

Freedom is just another word for "nothing left to loose"
Nothin', I mean nothing hon, if it ain't free no
Oh feeling good was easy oh-ho when he sang the blues
You know feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

From the Kentucky coal mines to the California Sun
Hey Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Hey Bobby-baby kept me from the cold

One day out near Salinas oh-ho, I let him slip away
He's looking for that home and I hope he finds it
Well I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday,
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom is just another word for "nothing left to loose"
Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
Well feeling good was easy oh-ho when he sang the blues
Hey feeling good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Lalala... Bobby McGee
Lalala... Bobby McGee
Lalala... Bobby McGee
Lalala... Bobby McGee

Call him my lover, call him my man,
I said I call him my lover just the best I can, come on
Bobby McGee, yeah
Lalala...
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee
Lalala...
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby McGee
