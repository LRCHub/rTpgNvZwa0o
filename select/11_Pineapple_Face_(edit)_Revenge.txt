Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

I'm trying and I see a form of love
Even though I fight it, I can't hide
With all the feelings in my head
And all the timings I have tried

Will anybody give me what I need?
Put all my faith in God above
This time I'm falling just for you
I guess I'm hungry for that love

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

I want you, I need you
And all the things you're asking for
"I'll try", she goes
Up and down like every man around

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Peace, in peace
Always live in peace
We live in peace, in peace
Always, always

Now you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
I can't stand living in the dark
Now you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
I know I must be strong
